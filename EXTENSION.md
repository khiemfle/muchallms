# Muchallms Extension

## Description

Muchallms is a Chromium extension that lets you run several LLM web UIs side by side, organize them into a clean grid, and send one prompt to all of them from a single controller. It is a lightweight way to compare outputs and keep your research in one place without leaving the browser.

## Why use it

- Less bias in answers: comparing multiple models helps reduce single-model blind spots and gives a more balanced view.
- Up to date across providers: you can quickly see how the latest versions of different LLMs respond to the same prompt.
- Faster domain learning: seeing the same keywords explained from different perspectives helps you learn new domain language and decide with more confidence.
